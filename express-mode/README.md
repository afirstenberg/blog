# Vertex AI Express Mode and LangChainJS

Vertex AI in Google Cloud offers a secure, robust, enterprise-scale,
platform for you do run AI operations in the cloud, including working
with Google's latest models such as Gemini and Imagen.
However, authentication can sometimes be a little tricky, involving
OAuth Service Accounts to keep the connections secure.

What if there was an easier way to access Gemini on the Google Cloud
Platform? This is now available with
Express Mode, where anyone who has a GMail account can use Gemini
on GCP with just an API Key.

Oh, and did I mention that it is free for 90 days?

Let's take a look at how to access Express Mode and use it with
LangChainJS, a popular library to access a wide variety of LLMs.
